Description: MPI_structure" and "parallel_structure" are two R functions that calls STRUCTURE automatically for a set of predefined jobs. Jobs are distributed among all available computing units (cores or cpu) in order to make the best use of multi-core computer while running analysis of large data sets in STRUCTURE. MPI_structure" and "parallel_structure" have the same functionality and use the same set of parameters. MPI_structure relies on Rmpi package whereas parallel_structure relies on the "parallel" package.
